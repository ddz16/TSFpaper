This repository contains a reading list of papers (**400+ papers !!!**) on **Time Series Forecasting/Prediction (TSF)** and **Spatio-Temporal Forecasting/Prediction (STF)**. These papers are mainly categorized according to the type of model. **This repository is still being continuously improved. In addition to papers that have been accepted by top conferences or journals, the repository also includes the latest papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). If you have found any relevant papers that need to be included in this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request (PR) or open an issue.** If you find this repository useful, please give it a ðŸŒŸ. 

Each paper may apply to one or several types of forecasting, including univariate time series forecasting, multivariate time series forecasting, and spatio-temporal forecasting, which are also marked in the Type column. **If covariates and exogenous variables are not considered**, univariate time series forecasting involves predicting the future of one variable with the history of this variable, while multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting the future of C variables with the history of C variables. **Note that repeating univariate forecasting multiple times can also achieve the goal of multivariate forecasting, which is called _channel-independent_. However, univariate forecasting methods cannot extract relationships between variables, so the basis for distinguishing between univariate and multivariate forecasting methods is whether the method involves interaction between variables. Besides, in the era of deep learning, many univariate models can be easily modified to directly process multiple variables for multivariate forecasting. And multivariate models generally can be directly used for univariate forecasting. Here we classify solely based on the model's description in the original paper.** Spatio-temporal forecasting is often used in traffic and weather forecasting, and it adds a spatial dimension compared to univariate and multivariate forecasting. **In spatio-temporal forecasting, if each measurement point has only one variable, it is equivalent to multivariate forecasting. Therefore, the distinction between spatio-temporal forecasting and multivariate forecasting is not clear. Spatio-temporal models can usually be directly applied to multivariate forecasting, and multivariate models can also be used for spatio-temporal forecasting with minor modifications. Here we also classify solely based on the model's description in the original paper.**

However, some spatio-temporal models set the output channel to 1, and even the input channel to 1, which is actually equivalent to multivariate time series forecasting.

## News.
ðŸš© 2023/11/1: **I have marked some recommended papers with ðŸŒŸ (Just my personal preference ðŸ˜‰).**

ðŸš© 2023/11/1: **I have added a new category ![Irregular_time_series](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Irregular-orange): models specifically designed for irregular time series.**

ðŸš© 2023/11/1: **I also recommend you to check out some other GitHub repositories about awesome time series papers: [time-series-transformers-review](https://github.com/qingsongedu/time-series-transformers-review), [awesome-AI-for-time-series-papers](https://github.com/qingsongedu/awesome-AI-for-time-series-papers), [time-series-papers](https://github.com/xiyuanzh/time-series-papers), [deep-learning-time-series](https://github.com/Alro10/deep-learning-time-series).**

ðŸš© 2023/11/3: **There are some popular toolkits or code libraries that integrate many time series models: [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS), [Time-Series-Library](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library), [Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet), [Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts), [Kats](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats), [tsai](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai), [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts), [PyTorchForecasting](https://github.com/jdb78/pytorch-forecasting), [tslearn](https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn), [AutoGluon](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon), [flow-forecast](https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow-forecast), [PyFlux](https://github.com/RJT1990/pyflux).**

ðŸš© 2023/12/28: **Since the topic of LLM(Large Language Model)+TS(Time Series) has been popular recently, I have introduced a category (LLM) to include related papers. This is distinguished from the Pretrain category. Pretrain mainly contains papers which design agent tasks (contrastive or generative) suitable for time series, and only use large-scale time series data for pre-training.**

ðŸš© 2024/4/1: **Some researchers have introduced the recently popular [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) model into the field of time series forecasting, which can be found in the SSM (State Space Model) table.**

ðŸš© 2024/6/7: **I will mark some hot papers with ðŸ”¥ (Papers with over 100 citations).**

ðŸš© 2024/9/10: **I am preparing to open [a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/ddz16/VSTFpaper) to collect papers related to Video Spatio-Temporal Forecasting (VSTF). The mapping function for VSTF is ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;H&space;\times&space;W&space;\times&space;L_1\times&space;C&space;\to&space;H&space;\times&space;W&space;\times&space;L_2\times&space;C), where ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;H) and ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;W) are the height and width of each frame. Compared to spatio-temporal forecasting mentioned before, it replaces ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;N) with ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;H&space;\times&space;W). This setup is commonly used in video prediction and weather forecasting. Stay tuned!**

ðŸš© 2024/10/23: **I have introduced a new table (Multimodal) to include papers that utilize multimodal data (such as relevant text) to assist in forecasting and a new table (KAN) to include papers that utilize Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks.**

ðŸš© 2024/12/30: **Christoph Bergmeir raised insightful questions about the benchmarks in the field of time series forecasting during [his talk at NIPS 2024](https://cbergmeir.com/talks/neurips2024/). This critique is highly valuable and well worth watching. I strongly recommend watching this talk before embarking on time series research.**
